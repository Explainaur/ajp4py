ajp4py Roadmap
===============

********
Goals
********

The goal for ajp4py is to be THE library you think of when you want to
communicate with a servlet container but without writing one yourself in Java.
This library is intended to be used by developers, pentesters, hackers, and
hobbists as the AJP library with the best programming interface available.

This can only be done if a community of users comes together and begins their
contributions. I can't do this by myself and I don't want to do it alone. I
need you to help make ajp4py as robust a utility library as it can be.

Features initially expected to be incorporated into releases are listed in the
 versions below in reverse chronological order.

Version ??
-----------

* Command-line ajp utility that works like httpie.

Version 1
-----------

* Establish connection with servlet container
* Graceful disconnection with servlet container
* Basic GET/POST/PUT functionality
